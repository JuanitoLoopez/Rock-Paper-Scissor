Play Rock-Paper-Scissors

I code a script for a popular game rock-paper-scissors as you know this work with some logic behind it.

I used JavaScript to create that logic and make this game works. I create multiple variables to save data and I use a function to run the play function and another function to play again.

I added modes for player like Two of Three or Three of Five. And also added a button to reset the counting.

I also used HTML to build the root and CSS for the styles.

I added three pictures of each option and added styles. All this using good practices.

I added media queries to create a responsive experience in this project.
